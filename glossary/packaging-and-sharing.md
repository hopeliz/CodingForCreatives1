# Packaging and Sharing

## Building, Compiling, and Exporting

Some code needs to go through an additional process before it can be saved and shared in a way others can run the code on a computer without the editor it was created in.

These terms are generally regarding this process. Most programs will give you options about what type of file you want the final form in or what system you'd like it to run on. It's best to find something universal or provide options between Windows \(.exe\) and Mac \(.app\).

Some exported/built/compiled results will be in a folder with multiple files. Be sure to package everything in a compressed folder and share it in that form.
